# Escape Rooms
You awake, blinded and memory-less. A voice whispers instructions in the crook of your ear, you can't help but stay awhile and listen.

Co-op horror first person game where one player has the control and is blind while the other player can see everything, but can't control.
The goal is to advance in a dungeon filled with deadly traps and voices. Can you both get to the end?

This game was developped by Mustafa, Ylan and David.
We won the first place in the competition OJam. http://www.ojam.ca/
48h was given to start and complete the game. The theme was "Stay awhile and listen".
